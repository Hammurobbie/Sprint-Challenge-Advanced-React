- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

I'd personally probably only use them if I was working with legacy code that used class components rather than functional, or an employer required me to work with them for any other reason.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

mounting(sets state and renders components), updating(any changes in state or props are rendered), and unmounting(components are removed from the DOM)

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

to make certain logic reusable/stateful

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

to prevent bugs/crashes before they happen and to become more comfortable/confident with our code
